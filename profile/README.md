Yes. We are the organisation who made the disk which is small but stores 7TB. The disk is based on:
1. Camera
2. Pen
3. Balls

You didn’t expect that!

## FAQ

#### How did we do this?

Yep, boy. This project took over 1 month and 1 week to be completed. We’ve had enough with that. The project was evolving, we spend too much £££ to get that. We got the disk - but based on cameras, balls, pens. We know!
## Installation

Install the util by downloading the `.rb` file and running it. You now have it working. The hot keys are - F1 = Connects to a computer, F2 = Opens the disk manager, F3 = Exit
